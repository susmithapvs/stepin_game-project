Introduction:

Rock, Paper, Scissor is a game project. it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

Objective:

Usually this game is played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Displays all moves to be performed.

Weakness:

 It's supposed to be a game of pure luck, not skill â€” and indeed, if humans were able to be perfectly random, no one could gain an upper hand over anyone else.
 
 Oppurtunities:
 
 Physical exercise will keep you physically fit and improve your muscles. Mental preparation helps you with focus, consciousness, concentration, and control of your mind.
 
 Threats:
 
 Time is of the essence
If you are not fast enough in your response, you are not playing the game. The opponent has to be matched. Fast analysis is key to responding to the competition.
